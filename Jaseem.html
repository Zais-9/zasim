I like to read, I like to write; I like to think, I like to dream; I like to talk, I like to listen. I like to see the sunrise in the morning, I like to see the moonlight at night; I like to feel the music flowing on my face, I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind, I like to do thought experiments when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night. I like flowers in spring, rain in summer, leaves in autumn, and snow in winter. I like to sleep early, I like to get up late; I like to be alone, I like to be surrounded by people.

                I always wanted to be a great writer, like Victor Hugo who wrote "Les Miserable", or like Roman Roland who wrote "John Christopher". They have influenced millions of people through their books. I also wanted to be a great psychologist, like William James or Sigmund Freud, who could read people's mind. Of course, I am nowhere close to these people, yet. I am just someone who does some teaching, some research, and some writing. But my dream is still alive.

It's called “analog” because it represents time through continuous, physical motion, as opposed to digital clocks that use numerical displays. An analogue clock has a clock face with a dial of numbers from 1 to 12. It uses an hour hand and a minute hand that rotate in a clockwise direction around the numbers to show the time. On an analogue clock, the longer hand shows the minutes and the shorter hand shows the An analog clock is a tool for reading the time of day. The longest hand indicates the seconds, the longer one indicates the minutes while the smallest one indicates the hours. The shortest hand indicates the hour, a longer hand indicates the minutes, and the longest arm indicates the seconds.

These shapes are "rock" (a closed fist), "paper" (a flat hand), and "scissors" (a fist with the index finger and middle finger extended, forming a V). The earliest form of "rock paper scissors"-style game originated in China and was subsequently imported into Japan.
